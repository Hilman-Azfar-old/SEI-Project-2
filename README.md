---

### Technical Requirements

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (or more, if they make sense)
* **Utilize a data store (i.e. PostgreSQL) to create a database** and interact with your data
* **Run a Node.js / Express.js server** from the command line
* **Respond to at least one HTTP GET and POST** request
* **Use at least 1 HTML React.js template**
* **Make a SELECT or INSERT query** to the PostgreSQL database on at least 1 route

### Extras
* **MVC
* **Include sign up/log in functionality** with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
* **Incorporate a CSS Framework** like Bootstrap for styling
* **Include API endpoints in your application**, i.e. have some /api/ name-spaced routes that return JSON data
* **Incorporate an External API** such as Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape
* **Allow uploaded images** by using a package such as Multer or a service like Cloudinary

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet (most likely Heroku)
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* an ERD diagram of your DB (this can be a photo of a piece of paper)
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publically-accessible **user stories you created**
