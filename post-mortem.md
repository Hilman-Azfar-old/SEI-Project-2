## Project Post Mortem

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
Design the backend first so I can have easier time retrieving data
Focus on the mvp first. Having features that support the project criteria is more important than fancy new buttons.
Trying new ideas and technologies is good but its benefits must outweigh the risk. 
Time spent learning new technologies could have been better used to deliver an even more polish product.
